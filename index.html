            <p>I am from a military family, so as one can imagine I have had the good fortune to live in various places. Originally,
                I am from Washingtom D.C., or least a suburb of it on the Virginia side, called Woodbridge. At the age of
                three, my father got stationed in Germany. In total, we stayed there for five years, and this is where I
                developed my passion for travel. After Germany we packed up and moved to Colorado Spring. I have been in
                Colorado ever since, for a grand total of seventeen years at this point.</p>
            <p>Since I have been in Colorado the longest, it is the place I call home. Upon graduation from high school, I attended
                the University of Colorado Boulder for four and a half year. While there, I pursued a degree in chemical
                and biological engineering with a minor in biochemistry. Truth be told though, I did not really much care
                for engineering. Graduation came quickly and I was finally able to do what I wanted, and that was to travel.
                I decided to take a gap year and travel. The single year morphed into two, but I was able to have hugely
                memorable trip, awesome experience, and meet some really cool people. Personally, I think life is all about
                experiences. </p>
